# Python packaging workshop
25.03.2025

## Assignment 1: python package management with uv
In this assignment we will initialize a new python project using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Some of the things uv will do for us: structure/configure `pyproject.toml`, add/remove dependencies, manage python versions and virtual environments, run linters and tests, publish to pypi.

### step 1
Create a new git repository, either on the commandline or in the github user interface.

Commandline:

```{sh}
$ mkdir new_project
$ cd new_project
$ git init 
```

Github:
Create a new repository in the [user interface](https://github.com/new) and copy the project url.

```{sh}
$ git clone <NEW_PROJECT_URL>
$ cd new_project
```

### step 2
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```{sh}
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### step 3
Initialize a new python project using uv. In this workshop we will focus on building a python package, but uv can also be used for smaller projects such a single scripts. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/init/ for various options on how to initialize a project.

```{sh}
$ uv init --package
```

This should give you a relatively barebones `pyproject.toml` file containing all your projects configuration. The following steps add functionality and dependencies to the project, which you can track in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Step 3
We're going to add some code, and a linter to see whether our coding style adheres to some best-practice standards.
